            <section id="hello">
                <h2>Hey!</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Eduardo. I'm a software developer / engineer / analyst / programmer / whatever. Basically, I do stuff with computers and proudly consider myself a master of none. I sort of fell in love with them from the moment I saw "Tron" and "War Games" when I was a kid. My first computer was a ZX Spectrum +2B (a couple of friends still make fun of me because I never had an Atari...).

            <section id="research">
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    I started out as a researcher at the <a href="http://nlx.di.fc.ul.pt/">NLX-Group</a>, affiliated to the Department of Informatics of the University of Lisbon, Faculty of Sciences. The group pursues research and development activities in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, with a special focus on natural language and speech interaction. During my time with the group, I developed a named entity recognizer for the Portuguese language which covered entities based on numbers (arabic, roman, fraction and magnitude numerals, measures, time expressions, etc.) and names (people, organizations, locations, etc.).

            <section id="enterprise">
                <h2>Enterprise</h2>
                <p>
                    Cue the enterprise world. So far, I've done (almost) a bit of everything by working at companies that span several areas of expertise (billing, data analytics, insurance, internet search, networks, pharmaceutics, telecommunications and web):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coriant</li>
                    <li>Google</li>
                    <li>Hovione</li>
                    <li>Nokia Siemens Networks</li>
                    <li>PT SI</li>
                    <li>TMN</li>
                    <li>VICTORIA Seguros</li>
                    <li><em>Warwick Analytics</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I currently work as a senior software developer at Warwick Analytics, an exciting startup that develops groundbreaking analytical solutions for big data problems, focusing on powerful predictive analytics that works without hypotheses and with dirty and/or incomplete data.

            <section id="technologies">
                <h2>Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    The programming languages I'm most comfortable with are Java and Python. I'm working on some personal projects to learn more about Scala, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, TensorFlow and Spark. I also love pattern recognition, which means that I'm a tad fluent in <a href="http://xkcd.com/208/">regular expressions</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also worked with several other technologies along the way (VBScript, ASP, Microsoft Internet Information Services v5.0 and v6.0, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005, Microsoft Access 2003 and 2007, SAP HTMLB, BSP, ABAP).
                </p>

            <section id="projects">
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>
                    On my spare time, I focus on small projects that cover a wide range of interests and topics, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>anarky</em>: Set of simple programs for encoding and decoding between several types of audio files</li>
                    <li><em>byth</em>: Small message broker that uses the stomp.py library to interact with ActiveMQ.</li>
                    <li><em>tic-tac-toe</em>: Simple implementation of the good old Tic-tac-toe game</li>
                    <li><em>sorting-algorithms</em>: Collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Java</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can find these projects at my <a href="https://github.com/MulberryBeacon/repositories">GitHub</a> account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the projects at the top of the queue that could be picked up in the near future are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement solvers for the Sudoku and Tower of Hanoi mathematical games</li>
                    <li>Tetris!</li>
                    <li>Pick up the work I did at the NLX-Group and release an open source (and thoroughly updated) named entity recognizer</li>
                    <li>Play around with the possibility of developing a regular expression engine</li>
                    <li>Explore the application of deep learning techniques to sports trading</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="interests">
                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    These are some of the topics that interest me:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
                    <li>Games</li>
                    <li>Mathematics</li>
                    <li>Natural language processing</li>
                    <li>Programming languages and techniques</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="hobbies">
                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    I tend to keep my brain busy with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cinema (more like an obsession... I wouldn't hesitate to call myself a movie snob)</li>
                    <li>Comic books</li>
                    <li>LEGO</li>
                    <li>Puzzles</li>
                    <li>Reading</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy exploring new languages. I'm currently learning German (at my own pace), and brushing up on my French and Spanish. Other languages will follow suit very soon (most likely Swiss German and Norwegian).
