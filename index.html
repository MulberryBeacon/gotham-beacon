                        <p>
                            My name is Eduardo Ferreira and I'm just your garden-variety software developer. I fell in love with computers from the moment I saw "Tron" and "War Games" when I was a kid. My first computer was a ZX Spectrum +2B (a couple of friends still make fun of me because I never had an Atari...).

                        <h2>Research</h2>
                        <p>
                            I started out as a research assistant at the <a href="http://nlx.di.fc.ul.pt/">NLX-Group</a>, affiliated to the Department of Informatics of the University of Lisbon, Faculty of Sciences. The group pursues research and development activities in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, with a special focus on natural language and speech interaction. During my time with the group, I developed a named entity recognizer for the Portuguese language which covered entities based on numbers (arabic, roman, fraction and magnitude numerals, measures, time expressions, etc.) and names (people, organizations, locations, etc.).

                            Cue the enterprise world. So far, I've basically done a bit of everything by working at several companies that represent a significant subset of what the IT market has to offer (information technologies, billing, telecommunications, pharmaceutical industry, internet search technologies and insurance industry):

                        <h2>Technologies</h2>
                        <p>
                            The programming language I'm most comfortable with is Java, although I've worked with other languages (C, JavaScript, etc.), and I'm currently investing some time in Python. I also love pattern recognition, which means that I'm pretty fluent in <a href="http://xkcd.com/208/">Regular Expressions</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If I do find the time and right motivation, I might delve into Web front-end technologies and expand my (very limited!) knowledge. I'd also like to sink my teeth in Android development and check out Django.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've also worked with several technologies (VBScript, ASP, Microsoft Internet Information Services v5.0 and v6.0, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005, Microsoft Access 2003 and 2007, SAP HTMLB, BSP, ABAP).

                        <p>
                            On my spare time, I focus on small projects that cover a wide range of interests and topics, including:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>tic-tac-toe</em>: A simple implementation of the good old Tic-tac-toe game</li>
                            <li><em>flac-manager</em>: A set of simple programs that allow a user to manage the conversion between several types of audio files</li>
                            <li><em>sniffer</em>: A simple and minimal application to log the names and values of the instance variables of session objects</li>
                            <li><em>sorting-algorithms</em>: A collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Java</li>
                            <li><em>scripts</em>: Set of utility scripts for frequently used programs or operations</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You can find these projects at my <a href="http://github.com/MulberryBeacon/repositories">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org/MulberryBeacon/profile/repositories">Bitbucket</a> accounts.

                            <li>Pick up the work I did at the NLX-Group and release an open source (and thoroughly updated) named entity recognizer</li>
                            <li>Explore the possibility of developing a regular expression engine</li>
                        </ul>
