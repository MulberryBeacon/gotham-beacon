            <h2>Hey!</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Eduardo. I'm a software developer / engineer / analyst / programmer / whatever. I do stuff with computers and proudly consider myself a master of none. I fell in love with them from the moment I saw "Tron" and "War Games" when I was a kid. My first computer was a ZX Spectrum +2B (a couple of friends still make fun of me because I never had an Atari...).

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                I started as a researcher at the <a href="http://nlx.di.fc.ul.pt/">NLX-Group</a>, affiliated to the Department of Informatics of the University of Lisbon, Faculty of Sciences. The group pursues research and development activities in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, with a particular focus on natural language and speech interaction. During my time with the group, I developed a named entity recognizer for the Portuguese language which covered entities based on numbers (arabic, roman, fraction and magnitude numerals, measures, time expressions, etc.) and names (people, organizations, locations, etc.).

        <section id="enterprise">
            <h2>Enterprise</h2>
            <p>
                So far, I've worked at companies that span several business areas (billing, commerce, data analytics, insurance, internet search, networks, pharmaceutics, telecommunications, and web):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can Factory</li>
                <li>Coriant</li>

            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                The programming languages I'm most comfortable with are Java, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I'm working on some personal projects to learn more about Python, Scala, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, TensorFlow, MySQL and Docker. I also love pattern recognition, which means that I'm somewhat fluent in <a href="http://xkcd.com/208/">regular expressions</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also worked with several other technologies along the way (VBScript, ASP, Microsoft Internet Information Services v5.0 and v6.0, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005, Microsoft Access 2003 and 2007, SAP HTMLB, BSP, ABAP).

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                On my spare time, I work on small projects that cover a wide range of interests and topics, including:

                <li><em>sorting-algorithms</em>: Collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Python</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can find these projects on my <a href="https://github.com/MulberryBeacon">GitHub</a> account.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I tend to keep my brain busy with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cinema (more like an obsession... I wouldn't hesitate to call myself a movie snob)</li>
                <li>Comic books</li>
                <li>LEGO</li>
                <li>Puzzles</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I also enjoy exploring new languages. I'm currently learning German (at my own pace), and brushing up on my French and Spanish. Others will follow suit very soon (most likely Swiss German and Norwegian).
